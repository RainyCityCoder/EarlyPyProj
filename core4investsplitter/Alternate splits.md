# From "The Index Card" by Helaine Olen & Harold Pollack:
## For a 40-year-old:
### 60% stocks, of which:
* 70% is S&P Index fund
* 15% is small-cap index fund
* 15% is international fund
### 40% long term bonds 
#### Per the book: 
* bond % should roughly = age
* long term bond investors expect higher returns for keeping their money "locked" in bonds (which are essentially loans to companies)
