README file for RainyCityCoder's Simple Average Finder

DESCRIPTION:
This program is designed to produce the average of input numbers. This program is 10-key friendly, and useful for quickly obtaining an average of a small group of numbers, especially if they are not easily ported to a spreadsheet program. It is much simpler than most full spreadsheet programs, and does not display your entered numbers in a similar fashion.
Built on Python 3

INSTALLATION:
Download the simpleaveragefinder.py file from the https://github.com/RainyCityCoder/simpleaveragefinder repository, or copy-paste the code into a Python file of your own. Please see the license file.

TO START:
Please Note: Commas are not currently supported. See ROADMAP.
1) Open file with your choice of Python-3-capable IDE, or run in a terminal capable of running Python 3 files. 
2) Run the program.
3) Program will first ask for numerical input. Enter as many individual numbers as you like, pressing "Enter" after each.
4) If you accidentally enter a comma, or anything other than an integer or floating point number, the program will flag it as an invalid entry, and won't count it against the count of number entries. 
5) When finished; type "done".

OUTPUT:
Program displays a printed line listing the total of the entered numbers, the count of numbers you entered, and the average (total√∑count).

RE-RUN:
See ROADMAP.
  
SUPPORT:
You may reach out to the creator via GitHub with suggestions to improve program (see ROADMAP).

ROADMAP/FUTURE FUNCTIONALITY:
1) Ask user: re-run/quit
2) Comma stripping
3) More functionality like median, mode, other statistics.

CONTRIBUTIONS:
Code contributions are welcome, preferably as messages to the creator containing suggestions to enhance functionality/fix bugs, with template code attached so the creator can problem-solve or implement new code on their own. The creator is currently building experience with Python 3, and with coding in general. Allowing the creator to learn and develope their skills is of more value to them than providing functional code and saying "put this in line X". Thank you for your understanding.

PROJECT STATUS
The Simple Average Finder is under developement.
